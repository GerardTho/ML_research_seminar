# Welcome to Our Machine Learning Project

We are excited to share our machine learning project with you! In this project, we have developed a model using graph neural networks. Our goal is to make this model accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.

## Understand our model

We have included detailed explanations of our model and the techniques we used. To learn more, navigate to the "Framework" page.


## Check our results

We believe in transparency and reproducibility. That's why we have created an API which allows third-parties to see the predictions made by our model.


Thank you for visiting our site, and we hope you find our project interesting and useful!
